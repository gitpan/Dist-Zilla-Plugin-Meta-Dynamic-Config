NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Meta::Dynamic::Config - set dynamic_config in
    resultant META files

VERSION
    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
      # In dist.ini

      [Meta::Dynamic::Config]

DESCRIPTION
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Meta::Dynamic::Config is a Dist::Zilla plugin that
    allows an author to specify in the "META.json" and/or "META.yml" files
    produced by Dist::Zilla that their distribution performs some dynamic
    configuration as per CPAN::Meta::Spec.

    Normally this would not be required, but if you are providing your own
    "Makefile.PL" or Build.PL and asking questions, sensing the environment,
    etc. to generate a list of prereqs then "dynamic_config" should be set
    to a true value to satisfy the Meta specification.
